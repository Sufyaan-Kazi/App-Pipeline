In this example we will create a continuous deployment pipleine using CloudBee's Jenkins, Artifactory and Pivotal Cloud Foundry

=== 3. Set build trigger

In this example we'll to poll the repo for changes very frequently to watch the pipeline run.

=== 4. Build Environment

Set the build environment to use Generic-Artifactory integration. We'll use Artifactory as the true for our deployment 
artifacts. We also control the number of artifacts we keep by discarding old builds.

=== 5. Trigger parameterized deployment

Upon completiong the deployment artifact and storing it in Artifactory, we will call a downstream Jenkins job to deploy our application into our development environment in Pivotla Cloud Foundry

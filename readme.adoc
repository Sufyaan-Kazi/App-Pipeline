= Integrated Pipelines for Hybrid Clouds

This document provides details on how to build integrated pipelines for Hybrid clouds using Cloudbee's Jenkins, Artifactory
and Pivotal Cloud Foundry with and emphasis on software delivery. 

We will explore the following use cases, which are very common when releasing software, 

. Continuous Delivery of a software release to a Platform, specifically Cloud Foundry.
. Software promotion through different environments, dev, test/QA and production
. link:http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html[Blue/Green] deployments using Cloud Foundry.
. Hybrid Cloud deployments

== Getting Started

This repo contains the instructions for creating your own Jwnkins Jobs to perform the use cases outlined above. 
It also contains a script called link:scripts/delivery.sh[delivery] and link:scripts/promotion.sh[promotion] which 
can be used independently of Jenkins to create your own scripts to cut-n-paste into Jenkins. These scripts test the 
different CF CLI commands outside of Jenkins to make testing easier.

We'll be using the link:https://github.com/omearaj/PCF-demo[PCF Map] application to demostrate our
